# Alexa

The Echo devices in our house respond to basic "turn on" and "turn off" commands for [this set of devices, groups, and scenes](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#smart-home). For example:

* Alexa, turn off the living room lights
* Alexa, turn on the great room
* Alexa, turn off the downstairs lights
* Alexa, set the wine room to 50 percent
* Alexa, turn on movie
* Alexa, turn on reading
* Alexa, turn on sleeping.

In addition, Alexa knows how to talk to *the house*. For example, to get help, you can say any of the following:

* Alexa, ask *the house* for *help*.
* Alexa, tell the *house* *help*.
* Alexa, *house* *help*.
* Alexa, open *house*. *Help*.
